**Ascii Art Generator!**
If you ever wanted to see your pictures 'ascii-fied' now you can! 
All you need to do is upload a photo and watch as your image turns into characters.

To get started you need to upload an image to a folder with this code, change 'input_im' to the name of your photo, change 'text_file' if you want, then run the program!
